# WebcamPainter
The goal is to build a webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (say your hand, or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush". 

The core programming was originally done in Java, then imported to GitHub. When run, the user can identify a part of the 
screen they want to designate as the paintbrush, and the program will find the largest connected part of the screen with
that same color and alow the user to paint. There exists the possibility for multiple brushes. Additionally, users may recolor
the screen. They will choose a part of the screen and if the command is set to recolor, it will make the part of the screen 
chosen change colors randomly each second.
